## About this project
This project is a command line version of the classic Hangman game. This game uses similar logic to the [browser-based Hangman game](https://github.com/sjbmarek/Hangman-Game) I created. In this command line version, Javascript constructor functions are used to create letter and word objects. Inquirer npm package prompts users to guess a letter, and Node.js runs the Javascript code from the command line. For more information on how this project was constructed and put together, see [Structure of the project](#structure-of-project).
